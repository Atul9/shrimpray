One of the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom can be found in
species of stomatopod crustaceans (mantis shrimp), some of which have
12 different photoreceptor types, each sampling a narrow set of
wavelengths ranging from deep ultraviolet to far red (300 to 720
nanometers). Functionally, this chromatic complexity has presented a
mystery. Why use 12 color channels when three or four are sufficient
for fine color discrimination? ---Science, Vol. 343, 24 Jan 2014

*shrimpray* is my first project in Rust. It is an implementation of a
ray tracer in Rust while following [[https://raytracing.github.io/][Ray Tracing in One Weekend Series]]
as a guide. The style of code attempts to be idiomatic while
minimizing mutables.  Wrapper types such as ~Option<T>~, ~Rc<T>~, and
~Box<T>~ are used. The mantis shrimp is a cool creature.

Additional renders can be found under the [[./render][render]] folder
