One of the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom can be found in
species of stomatopod crustaceans (mantis shrimp), some of which have
12 different photoreceptor types, each sampling a narrow set of
wavelengths ranging from deep ultraviolet to far red (300 to 720
nanometers). Functionally, this chromatic complexity has presented a
mystery. Why use 12 color channels when three or four are sufficient
for fine color discrimination? ---Science, Vol. 343, 24 Jan 2014
